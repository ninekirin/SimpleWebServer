    <h2>Original name</h2>
    <p>
      Flame Mountain, also known as "Kiziltag" in Uyghur, means "Red Mountain".
      It was once named "Volcano" by the Tang people due to its scorching heat.
      Flaming Mountain and Tongshan Mountain are barren, with no grass growing
      and birds disappearing. Every summer, when the red sun is shining in the
      sky, the reddish brown mountains are illuminated by the scorching sun, the
      sandstone is burning and shining, and the hot airflow is rolling and
      rising, just like a raging flame, the tongue of fire is stirring up the
      sky, so it is also known as Flame Mountain.

    <h2>History culture</h2>

      <li><span class="mm1">Cause for occurrence</span></li>
      <p>
        The Flaming Mountain is one of the branches of Tianshan Mountains, which
        was formed during the Himalayan orogeny 50 to 60 million years ago. For
        thousands of years, the countless fold belts left by the lateral
        movement of the Earth's crust and the wind erosion and rain stripping of
        nature have formed the undulating mountain terrain and vertical and
        horizontal gullies of Flame Mountain.

      <p>
        Flame Mountain has its unique natural appearance, and in the late Ming
        Dynasty, Wu Cheng'en hindered Tang Sanzang's access to the Flame
        Mountain. The story of Sun Wukong borrowing a banana fan was written
        into the famous ancient novel "Journey to the West", linking Flame
        Mountain with Tang Monk, Sun Wukong, Princess Iron Fan, and Bull Demon
        King, making it a magical mountain with rich colors and becoming a
        wonder in the world.

      <li><span class="mm3">Folklore</span></li>
      <p>
        According to Uyghur folklore, there is a dragon deep in the Tianshan
        Mountains that specializes in eating boys and girls. Send a special
        force to subdue the dragon. After a thrilling battle, the dragon was
        killed in the Qijiaojing Well in the northeast of Turpan. The dragon was
        wounded and traveled westward, staining the entire mountain with blood.
        Therefore, the Uyghurs call this mountain Red Mountain, also known as
        Flame Mountain.
