    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>
      Rainbow Beach is located in Burjin County, Altay Prefecture, northern
      Xinjiang. It is located on the first and second terraces on the north bank
      of the Erqi River, which flows into the Arctic Ocean in China. The rock
      colors here are variable, and under the sunlight at sunset, the color of
      the rock is mainly red, with green, purple, yellow, white, black, and
      transitional colors, making it colorful. Whenever the wind blows, strange
      sounds of varying lengths and heights are heard everywhere in ravines and
      under rocks.
